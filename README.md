🍎 PureChoice – Empowering Healthy Food Decisions
Overview
This project, developed as part of academics at Purdue University, tackles one of today’s pressing public health issues—identifying unhealthy food additives and misleading nutritional content in packaged foods. Using advanced data visualization techniques, R and Python-based data analytics, and a user-friendly Power BI dashboard embedded in a website, we help consumers make informed and healthier food choices.

📊 Project Highlights
Dataset: Extracted from Open Food Facts, containing over 3 million observations. Sampled 10,000 products for efficient analysis.

Technologies Used:

Data Wrangling: R, Python (pandas, numpy)

Visualization: PowerBI,Tableau, Matplotlib

Dashboard Hosting: Wix Website Embed

Key Features:

Interactive dashboard to explore food additives, sugars, saturated fat, sodium, and overall nutrition scores.

Ingredient breakdown and categorization of products as healthy or unhealthy.

Ranked food list based on health scores.

Average sugar content analysis: ~20g per 100g in packaged foods.

Over 200 products had more than 10 chemical additives.

💡 Motivation
Consumers often face confusing labels and hidden additives in packaged foods. This project aims to:

Visualize ingredient complexity.

Raise public health awareness.

Encourage cleaner eating habits via transparent data storytelling.

📈 Results
Developed a dashboard showing:

Packed bubble charts for additive frequency.

Treemaps of sodium levels.

Stacked bar graphs for sugar distribution.

Nutrition score pie charts.

Sample Insights:

36% of foods had nutrition scores under 10.

Top ranked items included natural nuts, sprouts, and hummus.

✅ Success Metrics
Increased user awareness of additives and nutrition.

Shift in purchasing behavior (based on user testing).

Enhanced decision-making for health-conscious consumers.

🚀 Future Work
Incorporate the full Open Food Facts dataset.

Add product search by name and barcode.

Partner with verified food databases for real-time updates.

Develop a mobile app version for barcode scanning and live analysis.
